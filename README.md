Graph-Based Recommendation Systems in Social Network Analysis Based on Community Detection Algorithms
This project develops a recommendation systems based on different community detection-based algorithms and compare
them with a graph neural network-based (GNN) recommendation system using various metrics like normalized discounted
cumulative gain, precision and recall, and time complexity. We implement the different community detection algorithms with
real social network datasets. In the next step, we use outputs from the previous step to develop our proposed community-based
recommendation systems. On the other hand, we reproduce a state-of-the-art GNN-based recommendation system. Finally,
we measure and compare our proposed recommendation system with the GNN recommedation system in using standard
various metrics. Although, the result show that our proposed recommendation system does not have a better performance in
comparison with GNN, but it also encourage us to research more in this direction in the future
